The python file is called prime age calculator. 
It will provide the next year when users age will be a prime number.
It can be opened in python and when running the file it will ask the user for their birth year. 
The user can enter their birth year as a number e.g. 2000, 
and it will print the next year in when the users age is a prime number, in this case 2029.

In order to run the file the external libary sympy is required.
The code was created using Python 3.9.
